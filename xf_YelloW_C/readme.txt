welcome to xf_YelloW_C

Install this theme as any other xoops theme. It will love you when you are
driving nice and valid html/CSS modultemplates but should work anyway, though.

to edit top menu with accesskeys and the dropdown menu, open theme.html
in an editor an edit links to destination you want.
